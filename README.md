## Introduction

Embark on a journey through the creation of a Full Stack Application with a dynamic front-end powered by JavaFX and a scalable back-end utilizing PostgreSQL. This repository serves as a testament to the fusion of elegant UI design and robust database management.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaFX:** Creating an immersive and visually appealing graphical user interface (GUI).
- **PostgreSQL:** A powerful relational database for seamless data management.
- **Java:** The backbone of the application, bridging the front-end and back-end seamlessly.

## Features

- **Sleek JavaFX GUI:** A modern and intuitive user interface designed with JavaFX.
- **Scalable PostgreSQL Database:** Seamless integration for persistent and scalable data storage.
- **Full Stack Architecture:** A harmonious marriage of front-end and back-end technologies.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensuring a smooth and interactive user experience.

## Project Structure

- **`/src`:** The source code directory containing packages for JavaFX front-end and PostgreSQL back-end logic.
- **`/database`:** Database-related scripts, configurations, and documentation.
- **`/docs`:** Project documentation, guides, and additional resources.
- **`/lib`:** External libraries and dependencies.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://gitlab.com/your-username/full-stack-app.git

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   cd full-stack-app

3. **Run the Application:**
   # Compile and run the JavaFX application
   javac -cp .:lib/* src/Main.java
   java -cp .:lib/* src/Main

4. **Explore the Application:**
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080 to access the application.

## Database Integration with PostgreSQL

- Ensure seamless data storage and retrieval through the PostgreSQL database. Check the database directory for database scripts, configurations, and guidelines on integration.
